# Eat Da Burger! 
Node Express Handlebars Assignment

This is a logger app using MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars.  More specifically Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

####How it works:

* A user can request a burger, which will display on the left side of the page.  

* Each burger generated will have a `Devour it` button, which will move the burger to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not.
